# The Shiden DAO Manifesto

## Preamble

Chaos is the mother of creation and innovation.

Ever since the dawn of humanity, we have strived to push the bar of what is “impossible.” Our sense of curiosity and creativity drove us to where we are now. However, as our society has evolved to encourage materialistic values. We often forget that Issac Newton did not theorize about gravity because he wanted to create a business or to go to the moon, despite being a crucial part of it.

Whereas mankind’s creativity fills the gap between our understanding of the universe versus the unknown reality of our world,

Whereas the wonder of this world drove mankind to explore the unknown and fuel our creativity for future generations,

Whereas technology is the combined byproduct of our sense of wonder and creativity,

Whereas innovation is using technology to solve problems that people face in a world where we are constantly seeing new problems as new solutions arrive,

Whereas corporations and those in power seek to maintain the status quo and use innovative technology as a means to an end which is their bottom line and total order (control),

Whereas consumerism blinded us from understanding the value of creativity and curiosity,

Whereas modern society only values those which are profitable and marketable while undermining the beauty of pure wonder and creativity,

Now, therefore,

The Shiden Dope Ass Organization OG Founders,

Declare chaos back upon this world with these tenants, representing our organization's core values and the rules governing the organization.

## Chapter 1: The Philosophy

### Article 1

Every human being has the right to ownership.

### Article 2

Everyone who is part of Shiden DAO is the founder and CEO of the Shiden DAO.

### Article 3

Every individual has the right to privacy.

### Article 4

Every organization has an obligation to be transparent.

### Article 5

Creativity and ambition shall not be overthrown by profitability or corporate needs. The Shiden DAO will empower the creators to focus on creating value and be incentivized directly by the community.

### Article 6

A value and success of a project will be measured by the support the project receives, not based on the token's price.

### Article 7

The blockchain does not care about one’s background, gender, religion, race, or wealth.

### Article 8

The founders will always think big, accept crazy, be swanky, act funny, and create chaos.

### Article 9

When others seek order and stability, we strive for chaos as chaos is the mother of creation. We, chaos, are unstoppable.

### Article 10

In the world of technology and code, nothing is impossible.

## Chapter 2: The Technology

### Article 1

Shiden DAO will be operating on Shiden Network, a Substrate-based layer 1 multi-VM community-driven incentivized smart contract platform and a parachain of Kusama Network. We are a platform for innovators.

### Article 2

Shiden Network is a canary network of Astar Network; therefore, Shiden is maintained under the Astar Network GitHub repository, with a lot of shared codebases.

### Article 3

As an open network, anyone can propose to add a new pallet to the Shiden Network through our governance process.

### Article 4

Shiden Network is an open smart contract platform; therefore, anyone can deploy any kind of dApps without permission.

### Article 5

The only limitation of Shiden Network will be one’s imagination. The motivation for building something on Shiden is to push the limitation of the technology, to have fun, and most importantly, why not?

### Article 6

Be proud of your work, and be humble about your achievements. Build something that you would use and write code as Gavin Would.

## Chapter 3: The Governance

### Article 1

The Shiden DAO is a decentralized democratic organization run by the community that follows these tenants.

### Article 2

Everyone in the Shiden DAO has the right to submit a proposal to improve the network or the community, and their voices will be heard if the community deems the proposal valid.

### Article 3

There will be limited seats for the Shiden DAO council, and the Shiden DAO community has the right to elect new council members or impeach existing ones.

### Article 4

Shiden DAO council members are expected to actively participate in the governance of Shiden DAO. Their interests must be motivated solely to improve Shiden Network and its community as they exist by and for the community.

### Article 5

The Shiden DAO council members will be responsible for enacting the most voted community proposals.

### Article 6

Every proposal submitted to the Shiden DAO governance will have at least two weeks of discussion and one week of a cool-down period for any second opinions or final assessments. During this period, the council members are expected to participate in the discussion and vote on the proposal. After the cool-down period, council members must do everything they can to enact the proposal.

### Article 7

The community and the council will decide on the Shiden DAO governance platform.

### Article 8

The council has the right to submit an executive proposal that only requires a majority vote from the council members and one week of the cool-down period without any restrictions in the discussion period. These proposals must be communicated to the DAO before their enactment, and the community has the right to veto the executive proposal within the cool-down period. In case of a veto, the executive proposal will be treated as a normal proposal described in article 6 until the veto is retracted.

### Article 9

The council has the right to delegate its power to other members.

### Article 10

Everything can improve and will change without exception. This includes the manifesto's content, and the change must be derived from the community’s voice.

Anyone can become a community member of the Shiden DAO when they call themselves a community member, actively participate and communicate with other members, and take this manifesto to heart.
