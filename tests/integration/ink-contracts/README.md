## Ink! Contracts

This directory contains Ink! contracts which are used in integration tests.

`.wasm` files in this directory are used by `pallet-contracts` scenarios, typically `src/xvm.rs`. The json
files are for informational purposes only and are not consumed by the tests.

The source code for the contracts can be found at https://github.com/AstarNetwork/ink-test-contracts
