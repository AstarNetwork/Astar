We expect to have this block time on average following the defined slot duration and the value of `c` configured for BABE (where `1 - c` represents the probability of a slot being empty). This value is only used indirectly to define the unit constants below that are expressed in blocks. The rest of the code should use `SLOT_DURATION` instead (like the timestamp module for calculating the minimum period)."],["MINUTES",""],["PRIMARY_PROBABILITY",""],["SECS_PER_BLOCK",""],["SLOT_DURATION",""]]});
