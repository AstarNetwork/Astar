# Contributing

## The `Neon` project is an **OPENISH Open Source Project**

* * *

## What?

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to a project to contribute as they see fit. A project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.

## Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
2. **Non-master branches** ought to be used for ongoing work.
3. **External API changes and significant modifications** ought to be subject to an **internal pull-request** to solicit feedback from other contributors.
4. Internal pull-requests to solicit feedback are _encouraged_ for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
5. Contributors should adhere to the [house coding style](https://wiki.parity.io/Substrate-Style-Guide).

## Releases

Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer(s).

## Changes to this arrangement

This is an experiment and feedback is welcome! This document may also be subject to pull-requests or changes by contributors where you believe you have something valuable to add or change.

## Heritage
These contributing guidelines are modified from the "OPEN Open Source Project" guidelines for the Level project: https://github.com/Level/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
