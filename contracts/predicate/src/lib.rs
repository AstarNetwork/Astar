//! Predicate Contract Trait provides a predicate contract specification and the ownership of predicate implementations.
//!
//! Predicate contracts define the rules for particular state objectsâ€™ exit game.
//! The most fundamental thing they define is the deprecation logic,
//! which informs the plasma contract that an exit on some states is invalid because it is outdated. Usually,
//! this logic is used to prove that a transaction has been invalidated.
//! Because the predicate contract is a stateful main-chain contract,
//! more advanced predicates can also define custom exit logics which must be evaluated
//! before any state transitions are approved by the predicate.
//! Thus, predicates can be used as fully customized extensions to the base plasma cash exit game.
//!
//! Refer to https://docs.plasma.group/projects/spec/en/latest/src/02-contracts/predicate-contract.html.
