//! Deposit Contract Trait provides deposit contract specification and default implementations.
//!
//! Deposit contracts are the contracts into which assets are depositedâ€“custodying the money.
//! It is transacted on plasma and playing out the exit games to resolve the rightful owners of deposited assets.
//! As such, it contains the bulk of the logic for the plasma exit games.
//! The things it does not cover are 1) block commitments, and 2) state deprecation,
//! that are handled by calls to the commitment contract and predicate contracts specifically.
//!
//! Refer to https://docs.plasma.group/projects/spec/en/latest/src/02-contracts/commitment-contract.html.
