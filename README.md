Astar Network is the leading dApps hub on Polkadot Network that support EVM smart contracts and cutting edge layer 2 solutions like ZK Rollups. Shiden Network is a canary network of Astar Network and a Parachain of Kusama Network.

Introduction
============

Astar Network is a scalable and interoperable infrastructure for Web3.0. Since Astar Network is built with [Parityâ€™s Substrate framework](https://www.substrate.io/), it can be a future [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) Parachain that also acts as a scalable smart contract platform. The Polkadot Relaychain, by design, does not support smart contracts. This allows Astar the opportunity to fill in this gap. Scalability is obviously one of the most crucial demands DApp developers have. Ideally, the developers can build whatever applications on Astar Network without having to consider its scalability. In addition to that, Astar Network is a multi virtual machines platfrom. Astar supports both Ethereum Virtual Machine and WebAssembly. All devs of Astar Network can deploy Solidity smart contracts by using existing Ethereum tools such as Metamask and Remix.

Based on the above, Plasm has some features.
- **[Optimistic Virtual Machine](https://docs.plasmnet.io/learn/optimistic-virtual-machine)**
- **[ZK Rollups](https://github.com/PlasmNetwork/ZKRollups)**
- **[DApps Staking](https://docs.plasmnet.io/learn/dapps-reward)**
- **[Operator Trading](https://docs.plasmnet.io/learn/operator-trading)**
- **[Lockdrop](https://docs.plasmnet.io/learn/lockdrop)**

Once Polkadot is launched, we will connect our root chain to Polkadot, and we aim to be one of the parachains.

Install Astar
=============

* Astar node binaries [releases](https://github.com/PlasmNetwork/Plasm/releases).
* Node [custom types](https://github.com/PlasmNetwork/Plasm/tree/master/bin/node/cli/res/custom_types.json).

> Latest version you can try to build from source.

Building from source
--------------------

Ensure you have Rust and the support software:

    curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
    # on Windows download and run rustup-init.exe
    # from https://rustup.rs instead

    rustup update nightly
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly

You will also need to install the following dependencies:

* Linux: `sudo apt install cmake git clang libclang-dev build-essential`
* Mac: `brew install cmake git llvm`
* Windows: Download and install the Pre Build Windows binaries of LLVM from http://releases.llvm.org/download.html

Install additional build tools:

    cargo +nightly install --git https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasm-gc

Install the Plasm node from git source:

    cargo +nightly install --locked --force --git https://github.com/PlasmNetwork/Plasm --tag v1.8.0-dusty plasm

Run node on [Dusty Network](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/Dusty):

    plasm

Or run on your local development network:

    plasm --dev

Building with Nix
-----------------

Install Nix package manager:

    curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh

Run on your Nix shell:

    git clone https://github.com/PlasmNetwork/Plasm && cd Plasm
    nix-shell nix/shell.nix --run "cargo run --release"

Astar Validator Program
=======================

Currently, we have 2 networks, [Dusty Network](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/Dusty) and [Astar Network](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/Plasm). Dusty is our live test network that contains the latest features for Astar Network.

If you would like to be the validator, please check out [our tutorial](https://docs.plasmnet.io/build/validator-guide) and join [Discord tech channel](https://discord.gg/wUcQt3R)
