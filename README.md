Astar Network is a dApps hub on Polkadot with unique features like dApps Staking, supporting mulit-virtual machine (EVM & WAsM), and offers layer2 solutions from day 1. Shiden Network is our sister network on Kusama.

## Trying it out

Simply go to [docs.astar.network](https://docs.astar.network) and follow the 
[installation](https://docs.astar.network/build/smart-contracts) instructions. You can 
also try out one of the [core features](https://docs.astar.network/learn/core-features).

## Contributing

Currently, we have 2 production networks:

- [Astar Network](https://astar.network/): formerly known as Plasm Network, and our future Parachain on Polkadot Network
- [Shiden Network](https://shiden.astar.network/): Parachain of Kusama Network and our canary release for Astar Network

And 2 test networks:

- [Dusty Network](https://github.com/PlasmNetwork/Astar/tree/development/dusty): an independent test network with the latest cutting edge features before it is introduced to Astar Network
- [Shibuya Network](https://github.com/PlasmNetwork/Astar/tree/development/shibuya): a Parachain test network with the latest cutting edge features related to XMCP, collators, and other cross chain operations that is planned to be rolled out to Shiden Network

In the future we will gradually change this structure to have a single test network.
