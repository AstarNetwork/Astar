# The examples in this file assume crate `A` to have a dependency on crate `B`.
workflows:
  # Check that everything is good without modifying anything:
  check:
    - [
        'lint',
        # Check that `A` activates the features of `B`.
        'propagate-feature',
        # These are the features to check:
        '--features=try-runtime,runtime-benchmarks,evm-tracing,std',
        # Ignore the features of dependencies that are exclusively used as dev or build.
        '--dep-kinds=normal:check,dev:ignore,build:ignore',
        # Do not try to add a new section into `[features]` of `A` only because `B` expose that feature. There are edge-cases where this is still needed, but we can add them manually.
        '--left-side-feature-missing=ignore',
        # Ignore the case that `A` it outside of the workspace. Otherwise it will report errors in external dependencies that we have no influence on.
        '--left-side-outside-workspace=ignore',
        # Some features imply that they activate a specific dependency as non-optional. Otherwise the default behaviour with a `?` is used.
        '--feature-enables-dep=try-runtime:frame-try-runtime,runtime-benchmarks:frame-benchmarking',
        # Show the paths of failed crates to have them clickable in the terminal: 
        '--show-path',
        # Aux
        '--offline',
        '--locked',
        '--quiet',
      ]
      # Format the features into canonical format:
    - ['format', 'features', '--offline', '--locked', '--quiet']
  # Same as `check`, but actually fix the issues instead of just reporting them:
  default:
    - [ $check.0, '--fix' ]
    - [ $check.1, '--fix' ]

    Astar uses the Zepter CLI to detect abnormalities in the feature configuration.
    It looks like at least one check failed; please see the console output. You can try to automatically address them by running `zepter`.
